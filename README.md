### Overview 

I remade my AngularJs project using ReactJs! I wanted to stick to the same asthetic so I did not style it differently</br>

#### Personal Notes

Core asthetic remained very similar because I enjoyed the simple look and similar feel. 
I did change how the weapon data is accessed. Originally I was making the silly mistake of retrieving the array of weapon object from a 
server. Now the json is being served as a constant in a js file. This significantly improved performance.
